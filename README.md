# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects implemented from scratch. Each project is structured with proper documentation, datasets, and source code.

## Projects

### 1. Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification
- **Description:** A binary classification problem where the goal is to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines.
- **Dataset:** Sonar dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
- **Notebook:** [sonar_classification.ipynb](./sonar_classification.ipynb)
- **Results:** Model performance comparison and accuracy evaluation.

### 2. Diabetes Prediction
- **Description:** A classification problem to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical features.
- **Dataset:** Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression,SVM ,kernal= linear
- **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC.
- **Notebook:** [diabetes_prediction.ipynb](./diabetes_prediction.ipynb)
- **Results:** Model evaluation and feature importance analysis.
